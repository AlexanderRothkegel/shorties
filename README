	Generates pictures from a file. Lines are assumed to represent different pictures. Each line is assumed to contain x*y different values which represent the color of the pixels in the picture.

calculateMeasures:
	Assumes that you have a large number of data files with name fileName_XXX_YYY where XXX and YYY are different numbers. CalculateMeasures can calculate the mean of all data files and put them into a single table in output file.

localMaxima/localMinimi:
	Calculate the series of local minima or local maxima of some time series.
